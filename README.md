# Sass Practice

This is a simple practice repo for Gulp with Node.js.

---
## Requirements

You will need to have Node.js.

If you don't have it, download it from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (I like to use the installer).

Next you will need Sass globally. Now that you have Node.js, you can open your Terminal and run:

    $ npm install --global sass

## Get this code

If you have Node.js and Sass installed, you're ready to get started with the code in the repo. Run these commands to get the code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Zhusufeng/sass-practice
    $ cd sass-practice
    $ npm install

## How to use
